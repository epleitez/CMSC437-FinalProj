# CMSC437-FinalProj
CMSC 437 - Summer 24
Project Definition

Design a user interface prototype for a patient monitoring device. 

First responders will use this device to monitor, and record the critical information
for a patient before the patient is transferred to the hospital. The monitoring device will be
connected to the hospital through the Internet while the patient is in transfer from the location to
the hospital. The hospital personnel will have the same view and the same functionalities
available remotely. The following figure presents a similar device from your companyâ€™s
competition.
